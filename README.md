# Recourses for the API-Tests

In this Repository are all the recources collected for testing the API. 
The API Documentation is created in Swagger and the base code for the backend (Server) is genereted by Swagger. 
For the tests, which will are done in Postman, is the code updated. 
Different classes, like OutlierdetectionApiController, and the Modelclasses are upgraded, so the tests can be hold 
and give the right responses.

## Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 

### Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
