# Recourses for the API-Tests

This repository contains all the resources required for API testing. The API documentation was created using Swagger,
and the base code for the backend (server) was generated by Swagger. For testing, which is performed in Postman, the
code has been updated. Various classes, such as OutlierdetectionApiController and model classes, have been enhanced to
ensure the tests are executed properly and provide accurate responses.

#### Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server

##### Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot
is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Start your server as an simple java application

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
